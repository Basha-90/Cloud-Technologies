# What is Cloud Native?
- An approach to building and running applications that fully exploit the advantages of the cloud computing model.
- Containerization ans Containers Orchestration
- DevOps and CI/CD Pipelines
- Microservices(architectural approach), Serverless, FaaS, IaC

# Cloud Native Applications
1. Infrastructure --> from on prem data center to Cloud (private, public, hybrid, multi)
2. Culture --> from Agile to Agile (Adaptive planing and design, evolutionary development) + DevOps (You build it, you run it. Vertical instead of horizontal structuring of teams) + DevSecOps (Security is right built in the development and Operation process)
3. Application Architecture --> from monolith to microservices.
4. Cloud Provisioning --> from manual to Infrastructure as Code(IaC).
5. Cloud Offering --> from IaaS, PaaS to Serverless and Function as a Service(FaaS).
6. Make the above process automated as much as it can be. Like CI/CD piplines.

Cloud Native is an application architecture — that is highly distributed, elastic and composable with the container as the modular compute abstraction. With that, a new breed of tools has emerged to help deploy, manage and scale these applications.

### Best practices for Cloud Native
Cloud-native computing as a series of foundations, beginning with agile development methods, then growing with DevOps adoption, the use of microservices software architecture, and deployment to an on-premises or public cloud.

Omdia's recommendations include beginning with the foundational pieces of a cloud native strategy: agile, DevOps, and continuous delivery. Then choose a container platform that’s built to be opinionated, removing admin chores, and simplifying the journey to deploying cloud-native applications.

Omdia also highlights key tools that are helping organizations with this process. These include Kubeflow, a multicloud framework for ML pipelines; Tekton, a Kubernetes-native project for CI/CD pipelines; and Kotlin, a JVM programming language that will integrate natively with legacy Java code.

# Serverless computing
Evolution of PaaS. 
Serverless computing is a method of providing backend services on an as-used basis. A serverless provider allows users to write and deploy code without the hassle of worrying about the underlying infrastructure. A company that gets backend services from a serverless vendor is charged based on their computation and do not have to reserve and pay for a fixed amount of bandwidth or number of servers, as the service is auto-scaling.
# Function as a Service (FaaS)
FaaS is a type of cloud-computing service that allows user to execute code in response to events without the complex infrastructure typically associated with building and launching **microservices** applications. Scalable pay-as-you-go functions as a service (FaaS) to run your code with zero server management. 
### FaaS services
IBM Cloud Functions  
Google Cloud Functions  
Azure Functions  
AWS Lambda (Amazon FaaS Compute)  
Amazon Aurora (Amazon Faas Database)  
Firebase (Google FaaS Database)  
Azure Data Lake (Microsoft Faas Database)  
### FaaS vs Serverless
FaaS is a subset of serverless and the central technology in serverless architectures. Serverless is focused on any service category (compute, storage, database, messaging, api gateways, etc) where configuration, management, scaling and billing of servers are invisible to the end user. Whereas, FaaS is the event-driven computing paradigm wherein application code, or containers, only run in response to events or requests.
